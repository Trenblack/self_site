# About Tren Black (me)
I'm on a mission to spotlight Arizona's stand-up comedy scene. I think New York and LA aren't the only hotspots for comedic talent, they just happen to be better at showcasing it. My goal is to reveal the comedy goldmine that Arizona truly is. I've been dedicated to capturing standup comedy since graduating with my B.S in Mathematics in May 2023.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Instagram. If you've ever gotten that notifications that say "two years ago today, you did this" while resurfacing an old photo, just know that I built that. I've also worked as an engineer at Amazon.

Before that, I was a [YouTuber](https://youtube.com/@trenblack) with 143k subscribers and 8 million page views. 

I'm currently working on producing my own show, Drunkalogues: Standup Comedy meets Trauma Dumping. Later this year, I will be directing, filming, and editing a special for one of the best comedians in all of Arizona.
