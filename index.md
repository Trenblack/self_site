# About Tren Black (me)
I'm capturing Stand-Up Comedy in Arizona in the highest quality (video and audio) possible. I aim to spotlight Arizona's stand-up comedy scene. I think New York and LA aren't the only hotspots for comedic talent, they just happen to be better at showcasing it. 

I've been capturing video professionally since 2019 as a former [YouTuber](https://youtube.com/@trenblack) with 144k subscribers and 8+ million page views. 

I've been focused on Stand Up specifically since graduating with my B.S in Mathematics in May 2023. Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Instagram. If you've ever gotten notifications that say "two years ago today, you did this" while resurfacing an old photo, just know that I built that. I've also worked as an engineer at Amazon.

I produce my own show [Traumady](https://i.ibb.co/WkD8tHp/trauma.jpg): Standup Comedy meets Trauma Dumping. This show is known to sell out comedy clubs around Arizona. Later this year, I will be directing, filming, and editing a special for an extremely talented comedian.
